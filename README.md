This package contains all translations.



Contribute
==========

The easiest way to provide a single translation is by creating a
[new issue](https://github.com/ordbok/translations/issues/new/choose). If you
like to contribute several translations, a pull request is the preferred way.
Please limit the number of changed files in each pull request to a maximum of
20 files. Take a look at the [templates](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) for
structuring the Markdown files.
